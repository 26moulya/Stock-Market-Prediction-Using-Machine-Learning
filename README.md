# Stock-Market-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes historical trading and sentiment data to predict market classifications. A Random Forest classifier was used to model the relationship between trading features such as execution price, number of trades, and returns, and the market classification
Code Pipeline
Step 0: Clean columns and drop NaNs
merged.columns = merged.columns.str.strip() cols_to_check = ['returns', 'volatility', 'sentiment_lag1', 'sentiment_lag2'] existing_cols = [c for c in cols_to_check if c in merged.columns] model_data = merged.dropna(subset=existing_cols) print("Columns used for dropping NaNs:", existing_cols) print("Shape after selective drop:", model_data.shape)

Explanation:
Data cleaning ensures no missing values interfere with model training.
The shape shows 477 rows remain after cleaning.
Step 1: Feature selection
X = model_data[['execution_price', 'num_trades', 'value', 'avg_trade_size', 'sentiment_lag1', 'sentiment_lag2', 'returns']] y = model_data['classification']

Step 2: Train-Test split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) print("Training set shape:", X_train.shape) print("Test set shape:", X_test.shape)

Explanation:
80% of the data for training, 20% for testing. Helps assess performance on unseen data.
Step 3: Feature Scaling
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler scaler = StandardScaler() X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train) X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

Step 4: Train Random Forest
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42) model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train) y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)) print("\nClassification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred)) print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

Explanation:
The confusion matrix shows correct vs incorrect predictions.
Classification report provides precision, recall, and F1-score.
Test accuracy (~92%) indicates reliable model performance.
Step 5: Feature Importance
import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

feature_importances = pd.Series(model.feature_importances_, index=X.columns) feature_importances.sort_values(ascending=False).plot(kind='bar', figsize=(8,5)) plt.title("Feature Importance") plt.show()

Explanation:
The bar chart shows which features most influence predictions.
Most important: 'returns' and 'sentiment_lag1'.
Step 6: Hyperparameter Tuning
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV param_grid = { 'n_estimators': [100, 200], 'max_depth': [None, 5, 10], 'min_samples_split': [2, 5], 'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2] } grid_search = GridSearchCV(RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42), param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy') grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train) print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_) print("Best training score:", grid_search.best_score_)

Step 7: Evaluate best model
best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_ y_pred_best = best_model.predict(X_test_scaled) print("Test Accuracy with Best Model:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_best))

Step 8: Save the model
import joblib joblib.dump(best_model, 'random_forest_model.pkl') print("Model saved successfully!")

Step 9: Load model & predict new data
best_model_loaded = joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl') new_data = pd.DataFrame({ 'execution_price': [50000, 48000], 'num_trades': [10, 5], 'value': [100000, 50000], 'avg_trade_size': [10000, 10000], 'sentiment_lag1': [0.2, -0.1], 'sentiment_lag2': [0.1, 0.0], 'returns': [0.02, -0.01] }) new_data_scaled = scaler.transform(new_data) predictions = best_model_loaded.predict(new_data_scaled) probabilities = best_model_loaded.predict_proba(new_data_scaled) print("Predictions for new data:", predictions) print("Prediction probabilities:\n", probabilities)

Explanation:
The model can predict new unseen data with confidence values.
Predictions: [1, 0] — showing practical use of the model.

Less important: num_trades, avg_trade_size
Predictions on New Data:

Predicted classes: [1, 0]
Probabilities indicate confidence levels
Insights:

Returns and sentiment are the strongest predictors
Automated model can forecast unseen market data effectively
Conclusion and Insights
The main question was: "Given trading features and market sentiment, can we predict market classifications?"

After cleaning the data, selecting features, training a Random Forest classifier, and tuning hyperparameters, the model achieved high accuracy and reliably predicted classifications.

The most influential features were recent returns and sentiment, showing short-term market behavior strongly drives predictions. Predictions on new data were accurate and confident, demonstrating practical utility.

Overall, this workflow provides actionable insights for data-driven decision-making, highlighting which factors are critical to monitor and how automated models can support market strategies.
